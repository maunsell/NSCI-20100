# NSCI-20100
Code for NSCI 20100 Lab
December 26, 2019

For the half of the course using microscopy, we use off-the-shelf applications to run the microscope camers and process images (Pylon 5 for MacOS and ImageJ).  The document called "Software Setup.docx" gives details and links for getting this software.

For the half of the course related to psychophysics and electrophysiological recordings, we use custom-written Matlab scripts.  Currrently these depends on LabJack U6 lab-IO hardward (requiring the LabJack Exodriver  and libusb -- see "Software Setup.docx") and the Psychtoolbox for creating visual stimuli.

Psychtoolbox is compatible with MacOS 13.6, but not with MacOS 14 or later.  Currently, the lab on Saccace RT has Matlab code written to work without Psychtoolbox.  We will need to update Contrast Thresholds and Saccade Metrics for the 2020-2021 academic year, because the iMacs in the NSCI lab will likely be moved up to MacOS 14 or higher by then.
