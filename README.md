For the half of the course using microscopy, we use off-the-shelf applications to run the microscope camers and process images (Pylon 5 for MacOS and ImageJ).  The document called "Software Setup.docx" in the Setup directory gives details and links for getting this software.

For the half of the course related to psychophysics and electrophysiological recordings, we use custom-written Matlab scripts.  Currrently these depend on LabJack U6 lab-IO hardward (requiring the LabJack Exodriver  and libusb -- see "Software Setup.docx").
