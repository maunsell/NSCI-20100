JHRM 180204

The Basler camera is handled by a C++ client application.  You might be tempted to put that C++ code
in this project (and use Objective-C++ (.mm files)) to communicate with it.  But I've never gotten
that to work.

This project uses sandboxing, so the outgoing network connection must be enabled in the entitlements.
