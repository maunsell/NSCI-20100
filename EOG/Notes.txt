Things to do:
    Need a main sequence plot across four offsets
    Put big numbers in upper left of each plot so they can be referred to in text

    EditText for filter width

See if the focus can be forced to the start/stop button.

============================
Read the Install Instruction to get information on adding Exodriver and UsbLib to the Macs. 

Because I am using an old version of Matlab(?), I had to do the following:

In Matlab.app/bin/mexopt.sh

Had to change calls to 10.7 to be more modern:

From these:

CC='xcrun  -sdk macosx10.7  clang'
MW_SDK_TEMP="find `xcode-select -print-path` -name MacOSX10.7.sdk"
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET='10.7'
CXX='xcrun  -sdk macosx10.7  clang++'

To These:

CC='xcrun  -sdk macosx  clang'
MW_SDK_TEMP="find `xcode-select -print-path` -name MacOSX.sdk"
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET='10.12'
CXX='xcrun  -sdk macosx clang++'


In Matlab.app/extern/include/tmwtypes.h

had to change:

#if defined(__STDC_UTF_16__) || (defined(_HAS_CHAR16_T_LANGUAGE_SUPPORT) && _HAS_CHAR16_T_LANGUAGE_SUPPORT)
typedef char16_t CHAR16_T;
#elif defined(_MSC_VER)

(near end), to read:

#if defined(__STDC_UTF_16__) || (defined(_HAS_CHAR16_T_LANGUAGE_SUPPORT) && _HAS_CHAR16_T_LANGUAGE_SUPPORT)
#define char16_t UINT16_T
typedef char16_t CHAR16_T;
#elif defined(_MSC_VER)

Apprantly my version of Matlab 2013a wasn't using C++11.
